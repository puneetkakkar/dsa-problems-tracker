# Smallest subarray with sum greater than x

### Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.

Note: The answer always exists. It is guaranteed that x doesn't exceed the summation of a[i] (from 1 to N).
 

#### Example 1:

    Input:
    A[] = {1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19}
    x  =  51
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    Minimum length subarray is 
    {4, 45, 6}

#### Example 2:

    Input:
    A[] = {1, 10, 5, 2, 7}
    x  = 9
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    Minimum length subarray is {10}


#### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N, x ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ A[] ≤ 10^4
