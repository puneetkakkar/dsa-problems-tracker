# Maximum Product Subarray

### Given an array Arr[] that contains N integers (may be positive, negative or zero). Find the product of the maximum product subarray.

#### Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 5
    Arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2}
    Output: 180
    Explanation: Subarray with maximum product
    is [6, -3, -10] which gives product as 180.

#### Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 6
    Arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 0}
    Output: 120
    Explanation: Subarray with maximum product
    is [2, 3, 4, 5] which gives product as 120.

#### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 500
- -10^2 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^2
