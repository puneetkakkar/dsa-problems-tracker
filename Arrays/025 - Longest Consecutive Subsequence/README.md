# Longest Consecutive Subsequence

### Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

#### Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 7
    a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
    Output:
    6
    Explanation:
    The consecutive numbers here
    are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 
    numbers form the longest consecutive
    subsquence.

#### Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 7
    a[] = {1,9,3,10,4,20,2}
    Output:
    4
    Explanation:
    1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest
    consecutive subsequence.

#### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^5
- 0 <= a[i] <= 10^5
