# Trapping Rain Water

### Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 

#### Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 6
    arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
    Output:
    10

#### Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 4
    arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
    Output:
    10
    Explanation:
    Water trapped by above 
    block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
    block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
    total unit of water trapped is 10 units.

#### Example 3:

    Input:
    N = 3
    arr[] = {6,9,9}
    Output:
    0
    Explanation:
    No water will be trapped.

#### Constraints

- 3 < N < 10^6
- 0 < Ai < 10^8
